## Description

The team decided to create a web page to search for local events. Our motivation behind this was to have an easier time planning a vacation, a quick outing or even a date night.The application searches for local events based on the city and state provided. When the event you wish to go to is selected you are prompted to buy the tickets or search for an Air BnB near the event, if a place of stay is needed. The team learned alot about working together, a new css platform, running GitHub and that APIâ€™s don't always have the information you're looking for.
